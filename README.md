## Code with GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces is a fully configured development environment hosted in the cloud. By using GitHub Codespaces, your workspace, along with all of your configured development environments, is available from any computer with access to the internet.

## Learning objectives
By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

* Describe GitHub Codespaces.
* Explain the GitHub Codespace lifecycle and how to perform each step.
* Define the different customizations you can personalize with GitHub Codespaces.
* Discern the differences between GitHub.dev and GitHub Codespaces.

## Add an "Open in Codespaces" Button to Your Project

To make it easier for contributors to work on your project, you can add an "Open in Codespaces" button to your project's README or any web page. This button provides a one-click way to open your project in a fully configured development environment in GitHub Codespaces.

### HTML Code Snippet for the Button

To add the "Open in Codespaces" button, include the following HTML code snippet in your project documentation:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/codespaces/new?repo=<repository_name>" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://github.com/buttons/open-in-codespaces.svg" alt="Open in Codespaces"/>
</a>
```

Replace `<repository_name>` with the name of your repository. This will link the button directly to the creation of a new Codespace for your repository.

### Customizing the Button's Appearance

You can customize the appearance of the "Open in Codespaces" button to match your project's branding. The button image can be replaced with any other image URL, and you can style the surrounding `<a>` tag with CSS to match your project's design.
